SWIFT Scaling Over Time
-----------------------

This repository includes some bash scripts that make scaling plots with
SWIFT (strong-scaling) showing how it has improved over time. Simply run
`all.sh`, and it will download v0.5.0 -> v0.8.0, and automatically
submit jobs to a slurm batch system.

This uses the `EAGLE_25` test case.
